	 * accessing any of the entities within the aggregate. This could for instance be "purchase order" or "customer"

	 * events related to purchase orders, one topic for all customer-related events etc. Note that also events
	 * pertaining to a child entity contained within one such aggregate should use that same type. So e.g. an event
	 * representing the cancelation of an individual order line (which is part of the purchase order aggregate) should
	 * also use the type of its aggregate root, "order", ensuring that also this event will go into the "order" Kafka
	 * topic.</p>

	 * for an order line cancelation event. This id will be used as the key for Kafka messages later on. That way, all
	 * events pertaining to one aggregate root or any of its contained sub-entities will go into the same partition of
	 * that Kafka topic, which ensures that consumers of that topic will consume all the events related to one and the
